#Sherlock QA

Sherlock QA is a attempt to simplify the life of testers, product owners and
people that do regression tests.

You should automate most your regressions tests, but sometimes you don't have the
means, time or you need to mix hardware and ask for people outside technology to test
you project.

### *** This is a beta version of Sherlock QA, don't use it in production ***

## TODO: DO a new documentation + Video of how to use + readthedocs

If you are eager to try yourself, just build the Dockerfile locally and run with the port 80:80 :)

This is a open-source project made with love in ![France](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoGalani/sherlock/master/sherlock/static/img/flag_france.png) and ![France](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoGalani/sherlock/master/sherlock/static/img/flag_brazil.png)

If you have good ideas and code skills, create a branch and push request ;)
